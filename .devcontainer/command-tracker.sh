# Command Tracking System

This system automatically tracks your commands during the QEMU exploration.

## Command Tracking

All commands you enter in the terminal are automatically logged to:
`output/commands/command_history.txt`

This happens automatically and requires no additional action.

## Review Your Progress

To review your command history:
```bash
cat output/commands/command_history.txt
```
EOF

echo "Command tracking system has been set up!"
echo "Please run 'source ~/.bashrc' or restart your terminal to activate tracking."
echo "See output/README.md for usage instructions."
